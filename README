                                     (VESS)

                                  Version 4.1.0



INTRODUCTION
============

VESS is a suite of libraries based on lessons learned from years of virtual 
environment research and is used to create the software for various virtual 
reality research applications at UCF/IST. 

The goal of VESS is to provide an application base that is useful and 
functional using today's hardware and graphics and audio libraries, extensible
to support future hardware and software libraries, and easily portable to 
multiple platforms, graphics and audio systems, and application programming 
interfaces (API's). 

VESS is currently available for SGI's OpenGL Performer and the open source
Open Scene Graph project under Linux and Windows.  An IRIX version also
exists but is not supported (we no longer have SGI machines on which to
test it).   VESS supports a wide range of input devices including the Polhemus
Fastrak, the Ascension Flock of Birds and MotionStar, the InterSense IS600, 
the FakeSpace PinchGlove box, keyboard, mouse, joysticks, and Spaceballs.  
A 2-D or 3-D menu system is also available, and a 1394 camera and video 
compositing ability is supported to allow for augmented reality!  In addition,
sound support is provided through the use of OpenAL, haptics support is 
provided for the PHANToM and CyberGrasp, and a powerful system of motion 
models is provided.  An olfactory driver for the ScentAir, Inc. ScentKiosk 
device is also included.  Four modalities in one library!
